# Maze-Game

The user chooses the size of the maze. Randomly placed in the maze of road, wall, monster, and gold. And their quantities are also random. 
The number of golds we collect during the game is shown to us when we reach the exit. The path we use during the game is saved in a .txt file.

#### Rules:
- Starting from the desired entry point.
- We check the points around where we are.
- If there are road options we can go. We stay from the closed roads.
- If there are golds we collect them.
- We stay away from monsters. If we get caught in them we'll get back to the starting.
- And we are at the end.
